```r
corrections <- list(
  FDR = p.adjust(p_values, method = "fdr"),          # False discovery rate
  Bonferroni = p.adjust(p_values, method = "bonferroni"), # Family-wise error rate
  Holm = p.adjust(p_values, method = "holm"),        # Step-down Bonferroni
  Q_value = qvalue::qvalue(p_values)$qvalues         # Q-value approach
)
```

**Method Selection**:

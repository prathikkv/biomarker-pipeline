## Biological Significance and Mechanisms

### CAMK2D as a Central Regulatory Hub

**Molecular Mechanisms**:

1. **Calcium Homeostasis Regulation**
   - Phosphorylates ryanodine receptors (RyR2) → controls calcium release
   - Modulates phospholamban (PLN) → regulates calcium reuptake
   - Effect size suggests major disruption of calcium handling

2. **Excitation-Contraction Coupling**
   - Central role in cardiac contractility
   - Large effect size (d=1.413) indicates profound impact on cardiac function
   - Consistent across all study types (literature, transcriptomic, proteomic, clinical)

3. **Pathophysiological Consequences**
   - **Heart Failure**: Altered calcium handling → contractile dysfunction
   - **Arrhythmias**: Aberrant RyR2 phosphorylation → calcium leaks → triggered activity
   - **Cardiac Remodeling**: Transcriptional effects on hypertrophy genes

### Network-Level Effects

**Systems Biology Insights**:
- CAMK2D functions as a "master regulator" with high network centrality
- Phosphorylation targets form interconnected functional modules
- Large effect size reflects cascade amplification through network effects

**Pathway Integration**:
- **Primary**: Calcium signaling (FDR < 0.001)
- **Secondary**: Cardiac muscle contraction, cAMP signaling, adrenergic signaling
- **Cross-talk**: Multiple pathway interactions explain pleiotropic disease effects

### Evolutionary and Cross-Species Validation

**Conservation Analysis**:
- 89% of CAMK2D targets show conserved expression patterns between human and mouse
- Calcium signaling pathway highly conserved (r = 0.92)
- Species differences primarily in immune-related genes
- Strong evolutionary conservation supports clinical relevance
